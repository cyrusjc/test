MongoDB Instructions
(skip this section and see below for MySQL Instructions if coming from MySQL course)

Enter touch mongodb-org-3.6.repo into the terminal
Now open the mongodb-org-3.6.repo file in your code editor (select it from the left-hand file menu) and paste the following into it then save the file:
[mongodb-org-3.6]
name=MongoDB Repository
baseurl=https://repo.mongodb.org/yum/amazon/2013.03/mongodb-org/3.6/x86_64/
gpgcheck=1
enabled=1
gpgkey=https://www.mongodb.org/static/pgp/server-3.6.asc
Now run the following in your terminal:
sudo mv mongodb-org-3.6.repo /etc/yum.repos.d
sudo yum install -y mongodb-org
Close the mongodb-org-3.6.repo file and press Close tab when prompted
Change directories back into root ~ by entering cd into the terminal then enter the following commands:
mkdir data
echo 'mongod --dbpath=data --nojournal' > mongod
chmod a+x mongod
Now test mongod with ./mongod
Remember, you must first enter cd to change directories into root ~ before running ./mongod
Don't forget to shut down ./mongod with ctrl + c each time you're done working
That's it! You're all set :)
